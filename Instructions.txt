Welcome to the META React JS interview.

We need a transfer list component.

A transfer list allows the user to pass items from one list to another.
UX has provided a mock up.

The transfer list should consists of two lists with actions buttons.
The user should be able to select one or multiple items and 
move the to the other list.
